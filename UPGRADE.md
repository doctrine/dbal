The default value of `$start` is now `null`, not `false`.

## BC BREAK The types of `$start` and `$length` in `AbstractPlatform::getSubstringExpression()` changed from `int` and `?int` to `string` and `?string` respectively

The platform abstraction allows building arbitrary SQL expressions, so even if the arguments represent numeric literals, they should be passed as a string.

## BC BREAK The type of `$char` in `AbstractPlatform::getTrimExpression()` changed from `string|false` to `?string`

The default value of `$char` is now `null`, not `false`. Additionally, the method will throw an `InvalidArgumentException` in an invalid value of `$mode` is passed.

## BC BREAK `Statement::quote()` only accepts strings.

Relying on string representation was discouraged and has been removed.

## BC BREAK: The `NULL` value of `$offset` in LIMIT queries is not allowed

The `NULL` value of the `$offset` argument in `AbstractPlatform::(do)?ModifyLimitQuery()` methods is no longer allowed. The absence of the offset should be indicated with a `0` which is now the default value.

## BC BREAK: Removed support for DB-generated UUIDs

The support for DB-generated UUIDs was removed as non-portable.
Please generate UUIDs on the application side (e.g. using [ramsey/uuid](https://packagist.org/packages/ramsey/uuid)).

    use Doctrine\DBAL\ParameterType;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Portability\Connection;

    $params = array(
        'wrapperClass' => Connection::class,
        'fetch_case' => ColumnCase::LOWER,
    );

    $stmt->bindValue(1, 1, ParameterType::INTEGER);
    $stmt->fetchAll(FetchMode::COLUMN);

## BC BREAK: Removed Drizzle support

The Drizzle project is abandoned and is therefore not supported by Doctrine DBAL anymore.

## BC BREAK: Removed dbal:import CLI command

The `dbal:import` CLI command has been removed since it only worked with PDO-based drivers by relying on a non-documented behavior of the extension, and it was impossible to make it work with other drivers.
Please use other database client applications for import, e.g.:

 * For MySQL and MariaDB: `mysql [dbname] < data.sql`.
 * For PostgreSQL: `psql [dbname] < data.sql`.
 * For SQLite: `sqlite3 /path/to/file.db < data.sql`.

# Upgrade to 2.11

## Deprecated `Synchronizer` package

The `Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Synchronizer\SchemaSynchronizer` interface and all its implementations are deprecated.

## Deprecated usage of wrapper-level components as implementations of driver-level interfaces

The usage of the wrapper `Connection` and `Statement` classes as implementations of the `Driver\Connection` and `Driver\Statement` interfaces is deprecated.

## Deprecations in the wrapper `Connection` class

1. The `executeUpdate()` method has been deprecated in favor of `executeStatement()`. 
2. The `query()` method has been deprecated in favor of `executeQuery()`. 
3. The `exec()` method has been deprecated in favor of `executeStatement()`. 

Note that `PrimaryReplicaConnection::query()` ensures connection to the primary instance while `executeQuery()` doesn't.

Depending on the desired behavior:

- If the statement doesn't have to be executed on the primary instance, use `executeQuery()`.
- If the statement has to be executed on the primary instance and yields rows (e.g. `SELECT`), prepend `executeQuery()` with `ensureConnectedToPrimary()`.
- Otherwise, use `executeStatement()`.

## PDO-related classes outside of the PDO namespace are deprecated

The following PDO-related classes outside of the PDO namespace have been deprecated in favor of their counterparts in the PDO namespace:

- `PDOMySql\Driver` → `PDO\MySQL\Driver`
- `PDOOracle\Driver` → `PDO\OCI\Driver`
- `PDOPgSql\Driver` → `PDO\PgSQL\Driver`
- `PDOSqlite\Driver` → `PDO\SQLite\Driver`
- `PDOSqlsrv\Driver` → `PDO\SQLSrv\Driver`
- `PDOSqlsrv\Connection` → `PDO\SQLSrv\Connection`
- `PDOSqlsrv\Statement` → `PDO\SQLSrv\Statement`

## Deprecations in driver-level exception handling

1. The `ExceptionConverterDriver` interface and the usage of the `convertException()` method on the `Driver` objects are deprecated.
2. The `driverException()` and `driverExceptionDuringQuery()` factory methods of the `DBALException` class are deprecated.
3. Relying on the wrapper layer handling non-driver exceptions is deprecated.

## `DBALException` factory method deprecations

1. `DBALException::invalidPlatformType()` is deprecated as unused as of v2.7.0.
2. `DBALException::invalidPdoInstance()` as passing a PDO instance via configuration is deprecated.

## `AbstractPlatform::fixSchemaElementName()` is deprecated.

The method is not used anywhere except for tests.

##`ServerInfoAwareConnection::requiresQueryForServerVersion()` is deprecated.

The `ServerInfoAwareConnection::requiresQueryForServerVersion()` method has been deprecated as an implementation detail which is the same for almost all supported drivers.

## Connection and Statement constructors are marked internal

1. Driver connection objects can be only created by the corresponding drivers.
2. Wrapper connection objects can be only created by the driver manager.
3. The driver and wrapper connection objects can be only created by the corresponding connection objects.

Additionally, the `SQLSrv\LastInsertId` class has been marked internal.

## The `PingableConnection` interface is deprecated

The wrapper connection will automatically handle the lost connection if the driver supports reporting it.

## `DriverException::getErrorCode()` is deprecated

The `DriverException::getErrorCode()` is deprecated as redundant and inconsistently supported by drivers. Use `::getCode()` or `::getSQLState()` instead.

## Non-interface driver methods have been marked internal

The non-interface methods of driver-level classes have been marked internal:

- `OCI8Connection::getExecuteMode()`
- `OCI8Statement::convertPositionalToNamedPlaceholders()`

## Inconsistently and ambiguously named driver-level classes are deprecated

The following classes under the `Driver` namespace have been deprecated in favor of their consistently named counterparts:

- `DriverException` → `Exception`
- `AbstractDriverException` → `AbstractException`
- `IBMDB2\DB2Driver` → `IBMDB2\Driver`
- `IBMDB2\DB2Connection` → `IBMDB2\Connection`
- `IBMDB2\DB2Statement` → `IBMDB2\Statement`
- `Mysqli\MysqliConnection` → `Mysqli\Connection`
- `Mysqli\MysqliStatement` → `Mysqli\Statement`
- `OCI8\OCI8Connection` → `OCI8\Connection`
- `OCI8\OCI8Statement` → `OCI8\Statement`
- `SQLSrv\SQLSrvConnection` → `SQLSrv\Connection`
- `SQLSrv\SQLSrvStatement` → `SQLSrv\Statement`
- `PDOConnection` → `PDO\Connection`
- `PDOStatement` → `PDO\Statement`

All driver-specific exception classes have been deprecated:

- `IBMDB2\DB2Exception`
- `Mysqli\MysqliException`
- `OCI8\OCI8Exception`
- `PDOException`
- `SQLSrv\SQLSrvException`

A driver-level exception should be only identified as a subtype of `Driver\Exception`.
Internal driver-level exception implementations may use `Driver\AbstractException` as the base class.
Driver-specific exception handling has to be implemented either in the driver or based on the type of the `Driver` implementation.

The `Driver\AbstractException` class has been marked internal.

## `Connection::getParams()` has been marked internal

Consumers of the Connection class should not rely on connection parameters stored in the connection object. If needed, they should be obtained from a different source, e.g. application configuration.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver::getDatabase()`

- The usage of `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver::getDatabase()` is deprecated. Please use `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::getDatabase()` instead.
- The behavior of the SQLite connection returning the database file path as the database is deprecated and shouldn't be relied upon.

## Deprecated `Portability\Connection::PORTABILITY_{PLATFORM}` constants

The platform-specific portability mode flags are meant to be used only by the portability layer internally to optimize
the user-provided mode for the current database platform. 

## Deprecated `MasterSlaveConnection` use `PrimaryReadReplicaConnection`

The `Doctrine\DBAL\Connections\MasterSlaveConnection` class is renamed to `Doctrine\DBAL\Connections\PrimaryReadReplicaConnection`.
In addition its configuration parameters `master`, `slaves` and `keepSlave` are renamed to `primary`, `replica` and `keepReplica`.

Before:

    $connection = DriverManager::getConnection(
        'wrapperClass' => 'Doctrine\DBAL\Connections\MasterSlaveConnection',
        'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
        'master' => array('user' => '', 'password' => '', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
        'slaves' => array(
            array('user' => 'replica1', 'password', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
            array('user' => 'replica2', 'password', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
        ),
        'keepSlave' => true,
    ));
    $connection->connect('slave');
    $connection->connect('master');
    $connection->isConnectedToMaster();

After:

    $connection = DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'wrapperClass' => 'Doctrine\DBAL\Connections\PrimaryReadReplicaConnection',
        'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
        'primary' => array('user' => '', 'password' => '', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
        'replica' => array(
            array('user' => 'replica1', 'password', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
            array('user' => 'replica2', 'password', 'host' => '', 'dbname' => ''),
        )
        'keepReplica' => true,
    ));
    $connection->ensureConnectedToReplica();
    $connection->ensureConnectedToPrimary();
    $connection->isConnectedToPrimary();

## Deprecated `ArrayStatement` and `ResultCacheStatement` classes.

The `ArrayStatement` and `ResultCacheStatement` classes are deprecated. In a future major release they will be renamed and marked internal as implementation details of the caching layer.

## Deprecated `ResultStatement` interface

1. The `ResultStatement` interface is deprecated. Use the `Driver\Result` and `Abstraction\Result` interfaces instead.
2. `ResultStatement::closeCursor()` is deprecated in favor of `Result::free()`.

## Deprecated `FetchMode` and the corresponding methods

1. The `FetchMode` class and the `setFetchMode()` method of the `Connection` and `Statement` interfaces are deprecated.
2. The `Statement::fetch()` method is deprecated in favor of `Result::fetchNumeric()`, `::fetchAssociative()` and `::fetchOne()`.
3. The `Statement::fetchAll()` method is deprecated in favor of `Result::fetchAllNumeric()`, `::fetchAllAssociative()` and `::fetchFirstColumn()`.
4. The `Statement::fetchColumn()` method is deprecated in favor of `Result::fetchOne()`.
5. The `Connection::fetchArray()` and `fetchAssoc()` method are deprecated in favor of `fetchNumeric()` and `fetchAssociative()` respectively.
6. The `StatementIterator` class and the usage of a `Statement` object as `Traversable` is deprecated in favor of `Result::iterateNumeric()`, `::iterateAssociative()` and `::iterateColumn()`.
7. Fetching data in mixed mode (`FetchMode::MIXED`) is deprecated.

## Deprecated `Connection::project()`

The `Connection::project()` method is deprecated. Implement data transformation outside of DBAL.

## Deprecated `Statement::errorCode()` and `errorInfo()`

The `Statement::errorCode()` and `errorInfo()` methods are deprecated. The error information is available via exceptions.

## Deprecated `EchoSQLLogger`

The `EchoSQLLogger` class is deprecated. Implement your logger with the desired logic.

## Deprecated database platforms:

1. PostgreSQL 9.3 and older
2. MariaDB 10.0 and older
3. SQL Server 2008 and older
4. SQL Anywhere 12 and older
5. Drizzle
6. Azure SQL Database

## Deprecated database drivers:

1. PDO-based IBM DB2 driver
2. Drizzle MySQL driver

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Sharding` package

The sharding functionality in DBAL has been effectively unmaintained for a long time.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Version` class

The usage of the `Doctrine\DBAL\Version` class is deprecated as internal implementation detail. Please refrain from checking the DBAL version at runtime.

## Deprecated `ExpressionBuilder` methods

The usage of the `andX()` and `orX()` methods of the `ExpressionBuilder` class has been deprecated. Use `and()` and `or()` instead.

## Deprecated `CompositeExpression` methods

- The usage of the `add()` and `addMultiple()` methods of the `CompositeExpression` class has been deprecated. Use `with()` instead, which returns a new instance.
In the future, the `add*()` methods will be removed and the class will be effectively immutable.
- The usage of the `CompositeExpression` constructor has been deprecated. Use the `and()` / `or()` factory methods.

## Deprecated calling `QueryBuilder` methods with an array argument

Calling the `select()`, `addSelect()`, `groupBy()` and `addGroupBy()` methods with an array argument is deprecated.

# Upgrade to 2.10

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Event\ConnectionEventArgs` methods

The usage of the `getDriver()`, `getDatabasePlatform()` and `getSchemaManager()` methods of the `ConnectionEventArgs` class has been deprecated. Obtain the underlying connection via `getConnection()` and call the corresponding methods on the connection instance.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Event\SchemaColumnDefinitionEventArgs` methods

The usage of the `getDatabasePlatform()` method of the `SchemaColumnDefinitionEventArgs` class has been deprecated. Obtain the underlying connection via `getConnection()` and call the corresponding method on the connection instance.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection` methods

The usage of the `getHost()`, `getPort()`, `getUsername()` and `getPassword()` methods of the `Connection` class has been deprecated as they leak implementation details.

## Deprecated array of statements in `addSql()` of `SchemaEventArgs`-based classes.

Passing multiple SQL statements as an array to `SchemaAlterTableAddColumnEventArgs::addSql()` and the same method in other `SchemaEventArgs`-based classes is deprecated. Pass each statement as an individual argument instead.

## Deprecated calling `AbstractSchemaManager::tablesExist()` with a string argument.

Instead of passing a string, pass a one-element array.

## Deprecated calling `OracleSchemaManager::createDatabase()` without an argument or by passing NULL.

In order to create a database, always pass the database name.

## Deprecated unused schema manager methods.

The following methods have been deprecated as unused:

- `AbstractSchemaManager::_getPortableFunctionsList()`,
- `AbstractSchemaManager::_getPortableFunctionDefinition()`,
- `OracleSchemaManager::_getPortableFunctionDefinition()`,
- `SqliteSchemaManager::_getPortableTableIndexDefinition()`.

# Deprecations in `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver`

- The usage of NULL to indicate empty `$username` or `$password` when calling `connect()` is deprecated. Use an empty string instead.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms::_getAlterTableIndexForeignKeySQL()`

Method `Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms::_getAlterTableIndexForeignKeySQL()` has been deprecated as no longer used.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\OCI8\OCI8Statement::$_PARAM`

Property `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\OCI8\OCI8Statement::$_PARAM` has been deprecated as not used.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver::getName()`

Relying on the name of the driver is discouraged. For referencing the driver, use its class name.

## Deprecated usage of user-provided `PDO` instance

The usage of user-provided `PDO` instance is deprecated. The known use cases are:

1. **Persistent PDO connections.** DBAL 3.0 will supported establishing persistent connections, therefore, providing a pre-created persistent PDO connection will be no longer needed.
2. **Sharing `PDO` instance between DBAL and legacy components.** In order to share a PDO instance, initialize the connection in DBAL and access it using `Connection::getWrappedConnection()->getWrappedConnection()`.

## MINOR BC BREAK: Default values are no longer handled as SQL expressions

They are converted to SQL literals (e.g. escaped). Clients must now specify default values in their initial form, not in the form of an SQL literal (e.g. escaped).

Before:

    $column->setDefault('Foo\\\\Bar\\\\Baz');

After:

    $column->setDefault('Foo\\Bar\\Baz');

## Deprecated `Type::*` constants

The constants for built-in types have been moved from `Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type` to a separate class `Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Types`.

Some of the constants were renamed in the process:
* `TARRAY`-> `ARRAY`
* `DATE` -> `DATE_MUTABLE`
* `DATETIME` -> `DATETIME_MUTABLE`
* `DATETIMETZ` -> `DATETIMETZ_MUTABLE`
* `TIME` -> `TIME_MUTABLE`

## Deprecated `SQLSrvStatement::LAST_INSERT_ID_SQL` constant

The  `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\SQLSrv\SQLSrvStatement::LAST_INSERT_ID_SQL` constant has been deprecated and will be made private in 3.0.

## Deprecated `SQLParserUtils` constants

The constants in `Doctrine\DBAL\SQLParserUtils` have been deprecated and will be made private in 3.0.

## Deprecated `LoggerChain::addLogger` method

The `Doctrine\DBAL\Logging\LoggerChain::addLogger` method has been deprecated. Inject list of loggers via constructor instead.

# Upgrade to 2.9

## Deprecated `Statement::fetchColumn()` with an invalid index

Calls to `Statement::fetchColumn()` with an invalid column index currently return `NULL`. In the future, such calls will result in a exception.

## Deprecated `Configuration::getFilterSchemaAssetsExpression()`, `::setFilterSchemaAssetsExpression()` and `AbstractSchemaManager::getFilterSchemaAssetsExpression()`.

Regular expression-based filters are hard to extend by combining together. Instead, you may use callback-based filers via `::getSchemaAssetsFilter()` and `::getSchemaAssetsFilter()`. Callbacks can use regular expressions internally.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type::getDefaultLength()`

This method was never used by DBAL internally. It is now deprecated and will be removed in DBAL 3.0.

## Deprecated `Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Type::__toString()`

Relying on string representation is discouraged and will be removed in DBAL 3.0.

## Deprecated `NULL` value of `$offset` in LIMIT queries

The `NULL` value of the `$offset` argument in `AbstractPlatform::(do)?ModifyLimitQuery()` methods is deprecated. If explicitly used in the method call, the absence of the offset should be indicated with a `0`.

## Deprecated dbal:import CLI command

The `dbal:import` CLI command has been deprecated since it only works with PDO-based drivers by relying on a non-documented behavior of the extension, and it's impossible to make it work with other drivers.
Please use other database client applications for import, e.g.:

 * For MySQL and MariaDB: `mysql [dbname] < data.sql`.
 * For PostgreSQL: `psql [dbname] < data.sql`.
 * For SQLite: `sqlite3 /path/to/file.db < data.sql`.

# Upgrade to 2.8

## Deprecated usage of DB-generated UUIDs

The format of DB-generated UUIDs is inconsistent across supported platforms and therefore is not portable. Some of the platforms produce UUIDv1, some produce UUIDv4, some produce the values which are not even UUID.

Unless UUIDs are used in stored procedures which DBAL doesn't support, there's no real benefit of DB-generated UUIDs comparing to the application-generated ones.

Use a PHP library (e.g. [ramsey/uuid](https://packagist.org/packages/ramsey/uuid)) to generate UUIDs on the application side.

## Deprecated usage of binary fields whose length exceeds the platform maximum

- The usage of binary fields whose length exceeds the maximum field size on a given platform is deprecated.
  Use binary fields of a size which fits all target platforms, or use blob explicitly instead.

## Removed dependency on doctrine/common

The dependency on doctrine/common package has been removed.
DBAL now depends on doctrine/cache and doctrine/event-manager instead.
If you are using any other component from doctrine/common package,
you will have to add an explicit dependency to your composer.json.

## Corrected exception thrown by ``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\SQLAnywhere16Platform::getAdvancedIndexOptionsSQL()``

This method now throws SPL ``UnexpectedValueException`` instead of accidentally throwing ``Doctrine\Common\Proxy\Exception\UnexpectedValueException``.

# Upgrade to 2.7

## Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::DATE_INTERVAL_UNIT_* constants deprecated

``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::DATE_INTERVAL_UNIT_*`` constants were moved into ``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\DateIntervalUnit`` class without the ``DATE_INTERVAL_UNIT_`` prefix.

## Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::TRIM_* constants deprecated

``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::TRIM_*`` constants were moved into ``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\TrimMode`` class without the ``TRIM_`` prefix.

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::TRANSACTION_* constants deprecated

``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::TRANSACTION_*`` were moved into ``Doctrine\DBAL\TransactionIsolationLevel`` class without the ``TRANSACTION_`` prefix.

## DEPRECATION: direct usage of the PDO APIs in the DBAL API

1. When calling `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement` methods, instead of `PDO::PARAM_*` constants, `Doctrine\DBAL\ParameterType` constants should be used.
2. When calling `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement` methods, instead of `PDO::FETCH_*` constants, `Doctrine\DBAL\FetchMode` constants should be used.
3. When configuring `Doctrine\DBAL\Portability\Connection`, instead of `PDO::CASE_*` constants, `Doctrine\DBAL\ColumnCase` constants should be used.
4. Usage of `PDO::PARAM_INPUT_OUTPUT` in `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement::bindValue()` is deprecated.
5. Usage of `PDO::FETCH_FUNC` in `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetch()` is deprecated.
6. Calls to `\PDOStatement` methods on a `\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOStatement` instance (e.g. `fetchObject()`) are deprecated.

# Upgrade to 2.6

## MINOR BC BREAK: `fetch()` and `fetchAll()` method signatures in `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement`

1. ``Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetch()`` now has 3 arguments instead of 1, respecting
``PDO::fetch()`` signature.

Before:

    Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetch($fetchMode);

After:

    Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetch($fetchMode, $cursorOrientation, $cursorOffset);

2. ``Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetchAll()`` now has 3 arguments instead of 1, respecting
``PDO::fetchAll()`` signature.

Before:

    Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetchAll($fetchMode);

After:

    Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\ResultStatement::fetch($fetchMode, $fetchArgument, $ctorArgs);


## MINOR BC BREAK: URL-style DSN with percentage sign in password

URL-style DSNs (e.g. ``mysql://foo@bar:localhost/db``) are now assumed to be percent-encoded
in order to allow certain special characters in usernames, paswords and database names. If
you are using a URL-style DSN and have a username, password or database name containing a
percentage sign, you need to update your DSN. If your password is, say, ``foo%foo``, it
should be encoded as ``foo%25foo``.

# Upgrade to 2.5.1

## MINOR BC BREAK: Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table

When adding indexes to ``Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table`` via ``addIndex()`` or ``addUniqueIndex()``,
duplicate indexes are not silently ignored/dropped anymore (based on semantics, not naming!).
Duplicate indexes are considered indexes that pass ``isFullfilledBy()`` or ``overrules()``
in ``Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Index``.
This is required to make the index renaming feature introduced in 2.5.0 work properly and avoid
issues in the ORM schema tool / DBAL schema manager which pretends users from updating
their schemas and migrate to DBAL 2.5.*.
Additionally it offers more flexibility in declaring indexes for the user and potentially fixes
related issues in the ORM.
With this change, the responsibility to decide which index is a "duplicate" is completely deferred
to the user.
Please also note that adding foreign key constraints to a table via ``addForeignKeyConstraint()``,
``addUnnamedForeignKeyConstraint()`` or ``addNamedForeignKeyConstraint()`` now first checks if an
appropriate index is already present and avoids adding an additional auto-generated one eventually.

# Upgrade to 2.5

## BC BREAK: time type resets date fields to UNIX epoch

When mapping `time` type field to PHP's `DateTime` instance all unused date fields are
reset to UNIX epoch (i.e. 1970-01-01). This might break any logic which relies on comparing
`DateTime` instances with date fields set to the current date.

Use `!` format prefix (see http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.createfromformat.php) for parsing
time strings to prevent having different date fields when comparing user input and `DateTime`
instances as mapped by Doctrine.

## BC BREAK: Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table

The methods ``addIndex()`` and ``addUniqueIndex()`` in ``Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table``
have an additional, optional parameter. If you override these methods, you should
add this new parameter to the declaration of your overridden methods.

## BC BREAK: Doctrine\DBAL\Connection

The visibility of the property ``$_platform`` in ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection``
was changed from protected to private. If you have subclassed ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection``
in your application and accessed ``$_platform`` directly, you have to change the code
portions to use ``getDatabasePlatform()`` instead to retrieve the underlying database
platform.
The reason for this change is the new automatic platform version detection feature,
which lazily evaluates the appropriate platform class to use for the underlying database
server version at runtime.
Please also note, that calling ``getDatabasePlatform()`` now needs to establish a connection
in order to evaluate the appropriate platform class if ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` is not
already connected. Under the following circumstances, it is not possible anymore to retrieve
the platform instance from the connection object without having to do a real connect:

1. ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` was instantiated without the ``platform`` connection parameter.
2. ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` was instantiated without the ``serverVersion`` connection parameter.
3. The underlying driver is "version aware" and can provide different platform instances
   for different versions.
4. The underlying driver connection is "version aware" and can provide the database server
   version without having to query for it.

If one of the above conditions is NOT met, there is no need for ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection``
to do a connect when calling ``getDatabasePlatform()``.

## datetime Type uses date_create() as fallback

Before 2.5 the DateTime type always required a specific format, defined in
`$platform->getDateTimeFormatString()`, which could cause quite some troubles
on platforms that had various microtime precision formats. Starting with 2.5
whenever the parsing of a date fails with the predefined platform format,
the `date_create()` function will be used to parse the date.

This could cause some troubles when your date format is weird and not parsed
correctly by `date_create`, however since databases are rather strict on dates
there should be no problem.

## Support for pdo_ibm driver removed

The ``pdo_ibm`` driver is buggy and does not work well with Doctrine. Therefore it will no
longer be supported and has been removed from the ``Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager`` drivers
map. It is highly encouraged to to use `ibm_db2` driver instead if you want to connect
to an IBM DB2 database as it is much more stable and secure.

If for some reason you have to utilize the ``pdo_ibm`` driver you can still use the `driverClass`
connection parameter to explicitly specify the ``Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOIbm\Driver`` class.
However be aware that you are doing this at your own risk and it will not be guaranteed that
Doctrine will work as expected.

# Upgrade to 2.4

## Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Constraint

If you have custom classes that implement the constraint interface, you have to implement
an additional method ``getQuotedColumns`` now. This method is used to build proper constraint
SQL for columns that need to be quoted, like keywords reserved by the specific platform used.
The method has to return the same values as ``getColumns`` only that those column names that
need quotation have to be returned quoted for the given platform.

# Upgrade to 2.3

## Oracle Session Init now sets Numeric Character

Before 2.3 the Oracle Session Init did not care about the numeric character of the Session.
This could lead to problems on non english locale systems that required a comma as a floating
point seperator in Oracle. Since 2.3, using the Oracle Session Init on connection start the
client session will be altered to set the numeric character to ".,":

    ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = '.,'

See [DBAL-345](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL-345) for more details.

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection and Doctrine\DBAL\Statement

The query related methods including but not limited to executeQuery, exec, query, and executeUpdate
now wrap the driver exceptions such as PDOException with DBALException to add more debugging
information such as the executed SQL statement, and any bound parameters.

If you want to retrieve the driver specific exception, you can retrieve it by calling the
``getPrevious()`` method on DBALException.

Before:

    catch(\PDOException $ex) {
        // ...
    }

After:

    catch(\Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException $ex) {
        $pdoException = $ex->getPrevious();
        // ...
    }

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#setCharsetSQL() removed

This method only worked on MySQL and it is considered unsafe on MySQL to use SET NAMES UTF-8 instead
of setting the charset directly on connection already. Replace this behavior with the
connection charset option:

Before:

    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection(array(..));
    $conn->setCharset('UTF8');

After:

    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection(array('charset' => 'UTF8', ..));

## Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table#renameColumn() removed

Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Table#renameColumn() was removed, because it drops and recreates
the column instead. There is no fix available, because a schema diff
cannot reliably detect if a column was renamed or one column was created
and another one dropped.

You should use explicit SQL ALTER TABLE statements to change columns names.

## Schema Filter paths

The Filter Schema assets expression is not wrapped in () anymore for the regexp automatically.

Before:

    $config->setFilterSchemaAssetsExpression('foo');

After:

    $config->setFilterSchemaAssetsExpression('(foo)');

## Creating MySQL Tables now defaults to UTF-8

If you are creating a new MySQL Table through the Doctrine API, charset/collate are
now set to 'utf8'/'utf8_unicode_ci' by default. Previously the MySQL server defaults were used.

# Upgrade to 2.2

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#insert and Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#update

Both methods now accept an optional last parameter $types with binding types of the values passed.
This can potentially break child classes that have overwritten one of these methods.

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#executeQuery

Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#executeQuery() got a new last parameter "QueryCacheProfile $qcp"

## Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement split

The Driver statement was split into a ResultStatement and the normal statement extending from it.
This separates the configuration and the retrieval API from a statement.

## MsSql Platform/SchemaManager renamed

The MsSqlPlatform was renamed to SQLServerPlatform, the MsSqlSchemaManager was renamed
to SQLServerSchemaManager.

## Cleanup SQLServer Platform version mess

DBAL 2.1 and before were actually only compatible to SQL Server 2008, not earlier versions.
Still other parts of the platform did use old features instead of newly introduced datatypes
in SQL Server 2005. Starting with DBAL 2.2 you can pick the Doctrine abstraction exactly
matching your SQL Server version.

The PDO SqlSrv driver now uses the new `SQLServer2008Platform` as default platform.
This platform uses new features of SQL Server as of version 2008. This also includes a switch
in the used fields for "text" and "blob" field types to:

    "text" => "VARCHAR(MAX)"
    "blob" => "VARBINARY(MAX)"

Additionally `SQLServerPlatform` in DBAL 2.1 and before used "DATE", "TIME" and "DATETIME2" for dates.
This types are only available since version 2008 and the introduction of an explicit
SQLServer 2008 platform makes this dependency explicit.

An `SQLServer2005Platform` was also introduced to differentiate the features between
versions 2003, earlier and 2005.

With this change the `SQLServerPlatform` now throws an exception for using limit queries
with an offset, since SQLServer 2003 and lower do not support this feature.

To use the old SQL Server Platform, because you are using SQL Server 2003 and below use
the following configuration code:

    use Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\SQLServerPlatform;
    use Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\SQLServer2005Platform;

    // You are using SQL Server 2003 or earlier
    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver' => 'pdo_sqlsrv',
        'platform' => new SQLServerPlatform()
        // .. additional parameters
    ));

    // You are using SQL Server 2005
    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver' => 'pdo_sqlsrv',
        'platform' => new SQLServer2005Platform()
        // .. additional parameters
    ));

    // You are using SQL Server 2008
    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver' => 'pdo_sqlsrv',
        // 2008 is default platform
        // .. additional parameters
    ));
