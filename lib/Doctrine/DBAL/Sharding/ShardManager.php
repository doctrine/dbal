/**
 * Sharding Manager gives access to APIs to implementing sharding on top of
 * Doctrine\DBAL\Connection instances.
 *
 * For simplicity and developer ease-of-use (and understanding) the sharding
 * API only covers single shard queries, no fan-out support. It is primarily
 * suited for multi-tenant applications.
 *
 * The assumption about sharding here
 * is that a distribution value can be found that gives access to all the
 * necessary data for all use-cases. Switching between shards should be done with
 * caution, especially if lazy loading is implemented. Any query is always
 * executed against the last shard that was selected. If a query is created for
 * a shard Y but then a shard X is selected when its actually executed you
 * will hit the wrong shard.
