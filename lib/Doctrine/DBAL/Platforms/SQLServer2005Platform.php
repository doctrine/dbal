/**
 * Platform to ensure compatibility of Doctrine with SQLServer2005 version and
 * higher.
 *
 * Differences to SQL Server 2008 are:
 *
 * - DATETIME2 datatype does not exist, only DATETIME which has a precision of
 *   3. This is not supported by PHP DateTime, so we are emulating it by
 *   setting .000 manually.
 * - Starting with SQLServer2005 VARCHAR(MAX), VARBINARY(MAX) and
 *   NVARCHAR(max) replace the old TEXT, NTEXT and IMAGE types. See
 *   {@link http://www.sql-server-helper.com/faq/sql-server-2005-varchar-max-p01.aspx}
 *   for more information.
