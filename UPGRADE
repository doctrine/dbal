# Upgrade to 2.2

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#insert and Doctrine\DBAL\Connnection#update

Both methods now accept an optional last parameter $types with binding types of the values passed.
This can potentially break child classes that have overwritten one of these methods.

## Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#executeQuery

Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#executeQuery() got a new last parameter "QueryCacheProfile $qcp"

## Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement split

The Driver statement was split into a ResultStatement and the normal statement extending from it.
This seperates the configuration and the retrieval API from a statement.
